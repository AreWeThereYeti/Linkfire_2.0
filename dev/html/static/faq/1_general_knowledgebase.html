        What is linkfire
    </h3>
    <p>
        Linkfire is a next-generation URL shortener, giving you the power to completely customise your links. You can keep your brand identity by adding your own domains. You can set different destinations for different users based on their location, device type and time period.
        And there's no need to wave goodbye once your link is flying across the web - you can edit and adapt your link at any time, without having to change your original URL. Linkfire is a free tool. However if you want more power, more options and more awesomeness, we have created some paid plans. All of them with a free trial of course.
