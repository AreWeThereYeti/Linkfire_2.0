        How to use the filter options?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Linkfeed shows you all the links created by you and the people you are connected to in teams. You may want to filter out some of these links and only view links with certain characteristics. You can filter by teams, members and creation period if you only want to view links created in a certain time period, or you can choose only to view links within a certain range of received shares or likes.
